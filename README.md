# My dotfiles

This is very much a constant WIP. My aim is to define a minimalistic config that is as light on the resources as possible without sacrificing much comfort. Any constructive input is appreciated. At the moment, my distro of choice is Alpine Linux for both desktop and servers.

## Requirements

* git
* stow

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:hisekai/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
stow .
```

### Main parts

* [i3wm](https://github.com/i3/i3) as WM
* [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) as status bar
* [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) as dmenu/app launcher
* [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) as terminal emulator
* [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) as shell
* [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) as the main editor
* [qutebrowser](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser) as the main browser
* [zathura](https://github.com/pwmt/zathura) as the document reader/viewer
* [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn) as the file manager
* [rmpc](https://mierak.github.io/rmpc/) as TUI for playing music
* [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) for streaming videos

The color scheme has been based on the [Black Metal Neovim Collection](https://github.com/metalelf0/black-metal-theme-neovim), the Burzum one in particular.

Then there are quite a few other important packages that are essential for my daily use: ffmpeg, yt-dlp, bottom, mpv, and feh among others.
